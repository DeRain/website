Company and its corporate affiliates will have primary responsibility for administering certain aspects of the ongoing development of the 0x Protocol.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Until recently, the 0x Protocol was developed by the Company&rsquo;s affiliate, ZeroEx, Inc. (&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">ZeroEx U.S.</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;).&nbsp; As part of a strategic reorganization, the Company and its corporate affiliates decided to administer ongoing development of the 0x Protocol from Company rather than ZeroEx U.S.&nbsp; It is anticipated that ZeroEx U.S. and other corporate affiliates will provide certain administrative, technical and development services to Company in connection with ongoing development of the 0x Protocol.</span></p><ol class="c4 lst-kix_list_24-0" start="2"><li class="c6 c8"><span class="c3">Transactions on the 0x Protocol</span></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c0">The 0x Protocol is an open-source protocol that is designed to facilitate peer-to-peer ERC20 token exchange interoperability among decentralized applications (&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">dApps</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;) built on the Ethereum blockchain. &nbsp;Transactions using the 0x Protocol are conducted by smart contracts, developed according to the 0x Protocol, that exchange ERC20 tokens directly between the parties on the Ethereum blockchain. &nbsp;There are two basic types of orders that may be sent or broadcast through the 0x Protocol: &nbsp;point-to-point and broadcast, as described below: &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Point-to-Point Orders.</span> <span class="c0">&nbsp;Parties interested in offering ERC20 tokens to trade (&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Makers</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;) can create an order to exchange one token for another by accessing a smart contract, inputting the desired exchange rate and the expiration time, and signing the order with a cryptographic key that authorizes the smart contract to access Maker&rsquo;s tokens (&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Order</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;). &nbsp;In a point-to-point Order, the Maker will also specify a particular party that is authorized to fill an Order (&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Taker</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;) and send the Order to the Taker through a communication medium. &nbsp;The Taker can then fill the Order by accessing the same smart contract and authorizing the smart contract to access Taker&rsquo;s tokens and execute the transaction. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Broadcast Orders.</span> <span class="c0">&nbsp;It is also anticipated that Relayers will host, maintain and broadcast off-chain order books that permit Makers to broadcast Order Messages in exchange for Broadcast Fees. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">If a Maker would like to broadcast an Order Message through a Relayer&rsquo;s order book, the Maker generally takes the same steps as in a point-to-point Order, but with two key differences. &nbsp;First, the Maker&rsquo;s Order does not specify a Taker address, thus allowing a broadcast Order to be filled by any Taker that intercepts it. &nbsp;Second, the Maker&rsquo;s broadcast Order specifies a Broadcast Fee value according to a Relayer&rsquo;s fee schedule and an address used by a Relayer to collect such fees, and authorizes the smart contract to transfer payment of the Broadcast Fee to the Relayer upon execution of the Order. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">If the Order is valid and provides the required Broadcast Fees, the Relayer will post the Order to its order book. &nbsp;Takers will then receive an updated version of the order book that includes Maker&rsquo;s Order, and may fill Maker&rsquo;s Order according to the same execution steps as described for point-to-point Orders. &nbsp;Broadcast Fees are paid to Relayers only upon execution of an Order, and must be paid in ZRX. &nbsp;Relayers do not have the ability to execute trades or handle user funds. &nbsp;Rather, Relayers only facilitate price signaling between market participants through generic messages on their order books. &nbsp;</span></p><ol class="c4 lst-kix_list_24-0" start="3"><li class="c6 c8"><span class="c3">Technical Governance of the 0x Protocol</span></li></ol><p class="c5"><span class="c0">While the 0x Protocol is a network protocol used to facilitate signaling between buyers and sellers (rather than a cryptoeconomic protocol), it is also intended to serve as an open standard for dApps that incorporate exchange functionality that can be updated from time to time. &nbsp;But when an Ethereum smart contract is deployed to the blockchain, its internal logic cannot be changed, thus creating the possibility of forking or disruption when a protocol update is proposed. &nbsp;To mitigate the potential of disruptive updates, the Technical Governance Voting mechanism is being developed for the 0x Protocol to facilitate decentralized approval by ZRX holders of proposed technical updates. &nbsp;Further, to encourage bona fide technical update proposals, a Technical Governance Fee (in ZRX) must be paid to the Development Pool (as defined in</span> <span class="c2">Exhibit B</span><span class="c0">) before proposing any technical update. &nbsp;</span></p><ol class="c4 lst-kix_list_24-0" start="4"><li class="c6 c8"><span

Such a lack of use or interest could negatively impact the development of the 0x Protocol and the potential utility of ZRX, including its use for Protocol Utility.</span></p><ol class="c4 lst-kix_list_31-0" start="11"><li class="c6 c8"><span class="c3">Risks Associated with the Development of the 0x Protocol</span></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Although the 0x Protocol will be deployed and operational at the time of the Token Sale, it is still subject to ongoing development and may undergo significant changes over time. &nbsp;Moreover, technical changes to the 0x Protocol are driven by Technical Governance Voting, which is outside of Company&rsquo;s control. &nbsp;How other participants, including Makers, Takers and Relayers, will use the 0x Protocol is also outside of Company&rsquo;s control. &nbsp;This could create the risk that ZRX or the 0x Protocol, as further developed and used, may not meet your expectations at the time of purchasing ZRX.&nbsp; It is also possible that the 0x Protocol will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed over time, which may negatively impact the 0x Protocol and the potential utility of ZRX, including its use for Protocol Utility.</span></p><ol class="c4 lst-kix_list_31-0" start="12"><li class="c6 c8"><span class="c3">Risk of an Unfavorable Fluctuation of Ether and Other Currency Value</span></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c0">The Company team intends to use the proceeds from selling ZRX to contribute to the ongoing development of the 0x Protocol, as described further in</span> <span class="c2">Exhibits A</span> <span class="c0">and</span> <span class="c2">B</span><span class="c0">. The proceeds of the Token Sale will be denominated in Ether, and may, at Company&rsquo;s discretion, be converted into other cryptographic and fiat currencies. If the value of Ether or other currencies fluctuates unfavorably during or after the Token Sale, the Company team may not be able to contribute to ongoing development of the 0x Protocol in the manner that it intended. &nbsp;Although the 0x Protocol will be deployed and operational at the time of the Token Sale, such unfavorable fluctuation may still adversely impact the 0x Protocol and the utility of ZRX, given Company&rsquo;s role in developing the 0x Protocol and its anticipated role in contributing to the ongoing development of the 0x Protocol. &nbsp;</span></p><ol class="c4 lst-kix_list_31-0" start="13"><li class="c6 c8 c15"><span class="c3">Risk of Dissolution of the Company</span></li></ol><p class="c6 c15"><span class="c0">It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of Ether (or other cryptographic and fiat currencies), decrease in ZRX&rsquo;s utility (including its use for Protocol Utility), the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the Company may dissolve. &nbsp;Although the 0x Protocol will be deployed and operational at the time of the Token Sale, the dissolution of Company may still adversely impact the 0x Protocol and the utility of ZRX, given Company&rsquo;s role in developing the 0x Protocol and its anticipated role in contributing to the ongoing development of the 0x Protocol. &nbsp;</span></p><ol class="c4 lst-kix_list_31-0" start="14"><li class="c6 c8"><span class="c3">Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights in Company</span></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Because ZRX confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to Company, all decisions involving the Company will be made by Company at its sole discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue contributions to the 0x Protocol&rsquo;s ongoing development or to sell or liquidate the Company.&nbsp; As noted above, the consequences of those decisions could adversely impact the 0x Protocol and the utility of ZRX that you hold, including ZRX&rsquo;s use for Protocol Utility.</span></p><ol class="c4 lst-kix_list_31-0" start="15"><li class="c6 c8"><span class="c3">Risks Associated with New and Evolving Laws Impacting Decentralized Application Technology</span></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c0">The distributed protocol and decentralized application ecosystem, and by extension the 0x Protocol, may be subject to a variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations, including those with respect to consumer privacy, data protection, consumer protection, content regulation, network neutrality, cyber security, intellectual property (including copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws), and others. These laws and regulations, and the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could change. &nbsp;In addition, new laws or regulations affecting the 0x Protocol could be enacted, which could adversely impact the Company, the 0x Protocol and ZRX, including ZRX&rsquo;s use for Protocol Utility.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Additionally, the users and developers of the 0x Protocol, including Makers, Takers and Relayers, may be subject to industry specific laws and regulations or licensing requirements. &nbsp;For instance, if Relayers facilitate the exchange of ERC20 tokens that are unregistered securities under U.S. state or federal law, they may be subject to regulatory enforcement or private litigation.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span> <span class="c0">More generally, if any of these parties fails to comply with any of these licensing requirements or other applicable laws or regulations, or if such laws and regulations or licensing requirements become more stringent or are otherwise expanded, it could adversely impact the 0x Protocol and ZRX, including ZRX&rsquo;s use for Protocol Utility.</span></p><ol class="c4 lst-kix_list_31-0" start="16"><li class="c6 c8"><span class="c3">Unanticipated Risks</span></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Cryptographic tokens such as ZRX are a new and untested technology.
